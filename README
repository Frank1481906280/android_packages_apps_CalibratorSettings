This is an app to modify calibration settings in roms that have this feature enabled in SurfaceFlinger.  It allows a user to scale their settings selection from 1 to 1000 for each color the screen outputs.  It defaults to 1000, as to avoid any potential hassle, but any other setting will load on boot.

Currently, the only good way to build this app is to add this folder to an up to date CyanogenMod source tree and run make -j4 Calibrator.  This is necessary as it is difficult to build this with the normal SDK due to the use of ServiceManager classes.
